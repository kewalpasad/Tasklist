# Task List App (Vanilla JavaScript)

This is a simple Task List App that adds and removes task. You can:

1. Add new Task
2. Search for Task
3. Delete single Task
4. Delete all Tasks
5. All The Tasks are stored on LocalStorage.

**_Screenshots_** are added in screenshots folder and each image is renamed according to the function performed on it.

_**Materialize**_ UI has been used to style the HTML. The entire project has been built on _**Vanilla Javascript**_ that is no frameworks have been used. JQuery is used only to import Materialize UI rest all The DOM manipulation and Document Selecting is done with Javascript. This project was built for learning purpose and is not intended to be used in any commercial project. The Task are stored on _**LocalStorage**_ so that refreshing the page wont delete the task list.

This Project has been taken from Brad Traversy's Modern JavaScript From The Beginning Course.
